# README
The activities on simulations will be carried out in  [OMNet++](https://omnetpp.org/)  environment.
## Introduction
Activities on simulation will be introduced by two classes on simulation concepts and OMNeT++ framework
* Introduction to simulation 
* Introduction to OMNet++ 
## Software
The simulator can be downloaded  [here](https://omnetpp.org/download/) . Please select the correct version for your OS. It consists in a library of C++ classes for simulation and IDE (based on Eclipse) where you can develop your projects using the library.
I’ve prepared a Virtual Machine, which runs Lubuntu (a lightweight Linux distribution), where everything is already installed and ready to use. You need to:
*  [Download](https://www.virtualbox.org)  the VM manager VirtualBox. A free application available for all OS. You need to download the host version
*  [Download](https://polimi365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/10511372_polimi_it/EZzdyxwRY7tLhJx3GhH-CtcB4aDvNQClG9WshneY4pGUeg?e=Vo1BRN)  the VM and install it in your VirtualBox (linux user password: markov)
## Material for personal study
In addition to the instructor’s introduction, you can find below additional material.
* OMNeT++ extended slide set (**TBD**)
*  [OMNeT++ Reference Manual](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/manual/) : It’s the full manual. Once you know how to run basic OMNeT++, you can find every detail and sophisticated aspect on this page.
*  [OMNeT++ API Reference](https://doc.omnetpp.org/omnetpp/api/index.html) : It’s the perfect place where to find all classes and methods to call which are built in OMNeT framework.
*  [Tic-Toc Tutorial](https://docs.omnetpp.org/tutorials/tictoc/) : It’s the best tutorial anyone wants to learn OMNeT++ should start from. It provides examples and code to follow step-by-step from a first simple project to a very sophisticated one.
Videos:
*  [First Video](https://youtu.be/kJ8ZK5uyFmY) : This video shows how to set up the first project in OMNeT by connecting a message source with a message sink.
*  [Second Video](https://youtu.be/zx2nyJyVEgk) : This video extends the project developed in the first video by adding a queueing system
